## What it does
By default, Steam does not show you the Steam Deck verification status on their
desktop website.
This Browser Extension/Add-On fixes that by requesting the verification status
from [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com) and puts them front and center on app pages for easy visibility.
While pulling the verification data from Steam directly, this also pulls the
medals ProtonDB gives to certain games and displays them on the app page too.

*Note: The extension uses session-based caching. 
This should reduce the consecutive load times significantly.*

### [SteamDB extension](https://steamdb.info/extension/) Compatibility
Since Version 1.2.0, this extension works great in combination with the SteamDB 
extension.

### [Steam Deck HQ](https://steamdeckhq.com) Support
Since Version 1.2.0, this extension also supports the
[game reviews](https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/)
by the Steam Deck HQ team.
This will show their ratings, breakdowns, and the
author of the review, on the app page.

This menu allows you to toggle certain features of the extension.
A reload for the page is necessary in order to see the settings take effect.

If you need any feature added or support for another page, feel free to open up an
[issue on GitHub](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz/great-on-deck-search/issues)
and I will see what I can do.

2. Search for the highest version appended by `+chrome`
3. Download the `.crx` file from it's assets
4. Open your browser with the `.crx` file

### Compile it Yourself
For compiling it yourself
[clone or download the repo](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz/great-on-deck-search/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
and put it in a directory of your choosing, just make sure that you will need
this directory even after installation.

Chrome and Firefox do have different specifications for extensions/add-ons,
therefore you need to rename corresponding manifest.json to simply
`manifest.json`.

Build the files by using the
[`build.sh`](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz/great-on-deck-search/blob/main/build.sh).
It requires [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
to be globally installed.

Install it on:
- [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked)
- [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing)
- [Opera, Step 4](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/basics/)
