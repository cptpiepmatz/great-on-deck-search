## What it does
By default, Steam does not show you the Steam Deck verification status on their 
desktop website.
This Chrome Extension (works also on Chrome-based browsers) fixes that by 
requesting the verification status from [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com).
While pulling the verification data from ProtonDB, this also pulls the medals
ProtonDB gives to certain games and displays them.

## Installation
Since this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, as I do not want to pay 
them money right now.
So you do have to install this manually.

1. Download the [files from this repo](https://github.com/cptpiepmatz/great-on-deck-search/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unpack the files in a directory of your choice, just make sure that you need these files as long you want to use the extension
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in your browser (this should also work in chrome-based browsers)
4. Select *Load unpacked* and select your directory with the unpacked files
5. And you're done!
